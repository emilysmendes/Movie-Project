Designed and developed a web-based movie database. Utilized RESTful API calls to enable CRUD (create, read, update, delete) functionality for dynamically rendered elements, including the use of modals to allow users to delete, add, and edit movies. Users can select individual checkboxes to delete multiple movies at once and edit movie details by title and year.
